# Soccer Challenge

I was challenged to built a soccer championship for a intern job interview, using HTML, Javascript and CSS.
The system was compose by the following Rules:
  -  Show in the screen a list of clubs and their respective cities for the first leg of the tournment;
  -  Show in the screen a list of clubs and their respective cities for the second leg of the tournment;
  - Randomize the result of the matches;
  - Find and show the Champion, considering: Win = 3 points, Draw = 1 point;
  - If there is more than one game in the same city at the same round show = "Rodada Dupla";
